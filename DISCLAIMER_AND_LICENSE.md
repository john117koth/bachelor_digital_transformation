Disclaimer, Intent, and Invitation
1. The Nature of this Artifact

This repository and the contained "Error-40" / 13D-Framework are primarily a rigorous thought experiment. It was developed as a strategic preparation for my academic journey toward a Bachelor in Digital Transformation.

The creation of this architecture serves as a personal "Stress-Test" to determine my capabilities for a distance learning program (Fernstudium). It is an exercise in synthesizing hyper-complex systems, philosophy, and technical infrastructure into a cohesive, documented whole.
2. An Invitation to the Mesh

While this is a preparatory study, it is also a living invitation. I believe that knowledge is only valuable when it is put into motion.

    If any concept within this framework resonates with your own projects...

    If a specific "Dimension" helps you solve a systemic bottleneck...

    If the logic of "Loose Coupling" or "Asynchronicity" offers you a new perspective on resilience...

Then I invite you to explore, adapt, and integrate it. This work is a contribution to the global dialogue on how we build structures that can survive the entropy of the modern age.
