Feasibility Analysis: Digital Transformation Readiness

This project acts as a Proof of Readiness (PoR) for the Bachelor of Science in Digital Transformation. It demonstrates proficiency in the following core competencies required for the degree:

    Strategic Complexity: The ability to map a 13-dimensional system shows the cognitive capacity to manage high-level digital infrastructures.

    Technical Documentation: Mastering Markdown, Git-flow, and modular documentation is essential for digital leadership.

    Architectural Thinking: The transition from "Tight Coupling" to "Loose Coupling" is the heart of digital transformation. This project proves that I do not just use technology; I understand its ontological impact.

    Self-Organization: Executing this "Thought Experiment" independently proves the discipline necessary for a successful Fernstudium (Distance Learning).

Conclusion: The Architect is ready for the Faculty. The hardware is tested. The software is optimized. The transformation can begin.
