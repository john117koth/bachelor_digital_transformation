System Integration & Asynchronous Deployment

To ensure the survival of this artifact, it must be integrated across multiple orthogonal platforms. This prevents a single point of failure (SPOF) and guarantees the Legacy (D12).
The Multi-Node Deployment Strategy

    Source Node (GitLab): The repository serves as the master version. Use Git as the primary tool for versioning and logic updates.

    Cognitive Node (GitBook): Sync the GitLab repository with GitBook for immediate public accessibility. This allows the framework to be "consumed" as a book.

    Eternal Node (Archive.org): Export the final Markdown files as a PDF and upload to the Internet Archive. This creates a time-independent snapshot (D4).

    Physical Node (Amazon KDP): Utilize the print-on-demand infrastructure to manifest the digital logic into a physical 3D object (D13).
